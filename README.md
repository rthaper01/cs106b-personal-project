# cs106b-personal-project
My final projects for Stanford's introductory programming abstractions course, CS106B, taken in Fall 2020.

I created and implemented multiple solutions for two problems, [Classical Music Festival](./Musical%20Modulations/classical-music-festival.pdf) and Musical Modulations.
