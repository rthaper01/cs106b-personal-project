# cs106b-personal-project
My final projects for Stanford's introductory programming abstractions course, CS106B, taken in Fall 2020.

I created and implemented multiple solutions for two problems, [Classical Music Festival](./Classical%20Music%Festival/musicevents) and [Musical Modulations](./Musical%20Modulations/modulate.cpp).

The problem statements are as follows:

__Classical Music Festival__: Given a Vector<pair<int, int>> of musical events containing their admission fees and durations and a budget limit, determine the maximum number of minutes of music you can listen to while staying under budget.

__Musical Modulations__: Given a starting key, ending key, and a set of allowed related keys to which you can modulate, compute the shortest path of successive modulations from the starting key to the ending key.
